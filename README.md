# Improvement Roll

This is a tiny project which sprung from an app I saw. You basically tell the app how much free time you have currently and it randomly picks a task that you can work on in that duration of time. I thought that an app seems too heavy an implementation for such a thing and so created this project. In the end I want to take this to a PWA destination so that it remains available offline once loaded.
